# appclientes
App autoral para cadastro de clientes

App created for administration purposes. 


### App flow

Register the costumer with adress, store the consumes with it's prices, control everyday deliverys. 

----

That's an autoral webApp that I am creating, using:
#####  Front-End: - ReactJS 
#####  Back-End: - NodeJS (Until now)
  
`Working on implementing another technologies for the storage.`



The idea is to make a system that can accept all the data about the costumer and storage them, having access to those informations easily and beeing able to add new items to the "account" of the costumer.



Thats the React version of my Clients personal app. I decided to make it public, so I can share the idea. It started simple, just to control my job informations and stuff. But I decided to further and now, I can look it from a great perspective. That's an app where I pretend to automatizate a lot of things, but that requires a lot of humans time. Those are easy tasks, but I have to deal with them everyday. So, I realized that I'm a programmer, and my duty is to automatizate all that and try to take the maximum of it, learning every time!
